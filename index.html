                    <h2>Is it possible to feed weed?</h2>
                    <h3>It is been told by centuries that our better chances to get sweet weed is to let it be</h3>
                    <p>
                        After a lot of travels and investigation through the Amazonas our especialists have seen the
                        innevitable, out weed is evolving in impredictable ways and out consuming is making some of
                        us saw them as a simbiotic plant that once in our side can be as good food to blow up more 
                        than one mind, isn't extrange that such a nice plant give so much to us after all the love 
                        we can give to it, sure not all people have the brave to show a connection with this live been
                        , but fortunately there is hope in better relationships, because after all what exists does it
                        because connections and the most beautiful things shows the most beautiful connections, so it
                        is on quantity? As much as i would love to say yes, don't forget just one connection could be
                        stronger than ten as one metal than one paper so you can try to follow a model or just know
                        how to appreciate what is in front of you so you would found another way to go through...
