                        us saw them as a simbiotic plant that once in our side can be as good food to blow up more 
                        than one mind, isn't extrange that such a nice plant give so much to us after all the love

                        because connections and the most beautiful things shows the most beautiful connections, so it
                        is on quantity? As much as i would love to say yes, don't forget just one connection could be
                        stronger than ten as one metal than one paper so you can try to follow a model or just know
                        how to appreciate what is in front of you so you would found another way to go through...
